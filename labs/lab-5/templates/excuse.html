  <h1>ðŸ˜· I Was Sick ðŸ˜·</h1>
  <p>Sorry for submitting this lab late. I was sick and barely functioning. Between sneezing every 3 seconds and sleeping 18 hours a day, this lab didnâ€™t stand a chance. I tried to code through the coughs, but didn't go well as my brain was not creative enough.</p>
