.. _`Development`:

Development
===========
This section is intended for developers that want to create a fix or develop an enhancement to the CMPT 221 application.

Code of Conduct
---------------
Write clear commit messages and ensure all tests pass before submitting changes. All labs must be completed in their respective branches.

Repository
----------
The repository for CMPT 221 is on Github: https://github.com/kritikajoshi006/cmpt221

Development Environment
-----------------------
A `Python virtual environment`_ is recommended. Once the virtual environment is activated, clone the <application-name> repository and prepare the development environment with 

.. _Python virtual environment: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/

.. code-block:: text

    $ git clone <project-repository-clone-link>
    $ cd <root-directory>
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all local prerequisites needed for ``cmpt 221`` to run.

Pytest
-------------------
Unit tests are developed using Pytest. To run the test suite, issue:

.. code-block:: text

    $ cd tests
    $ pytest <filename.py>

Build Documentation
-------------------
The Github pages site is used to publish documentation for the cmpt 221 application at https://kritikajoshi006.github.io/cmpt221/


To build the documentation, issue:

.. code-block:: text
    
    $ cd docs
    $ make html
    # windows users without make installed use:
    $ make.bat html

The top-level document to open with a web-browser will be  ``docs/_build/html/index.html``.

To publish the page, copy the contents of the directory ``docs/_build/html`` into the branch
``gh-pages``. Then, commit and push to ``gh-pages``.
